# How-to-load-7gb-models-on-Android
STABLE DIFFUSION FORGE ANDROID USE GUIDE



update: also putting your apps in deep sleep mode free up ram

To use SDXL on 12 gb RAM phone with stable-diffusion-webui-forge u hVe to factory reset your phone.  then after u do that only install termux and stargon browser then install  the least amount of apps possible this will release the most amount of ram. this is the only way to load 7gb models In forge. currently sdxl only works in forge I tried automatic1111 but it crashes every time I try to load a 7gb model in automatic1111 but 5.30 gb models load fine. 



if u want to do text to video u can use the seed travel extension   it allows u to make animated videos by combining seeds. I use it and love it!! it works very good and doesn't use up vram or ram and doesn't crash automatic1111. I wanted to try sd1.5 in
Forge but the generations take to long
automatic1111 is best for sd1.5 and sdxl Is better for forge, in android.
